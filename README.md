# System-Wide-Models
This repository contains the different urban wastewater system-wide models developed between [Lund University](https://www.iea.lth.se/) and [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.kt.dtu.dk/english/research/prosys). The models are mainly developed as a part of the [PhD thesis](https://www.iea.lth.se/publications/Theses/LTH-IEA-1083.pdf) by [Ramesh Saagi](https://github.com/rsaagi)

There are two implementations available
1. BSM-UWS - This contains all the subsystems (catchment, sewer network, wastewater treatment plant and river water system).
2. BSMSewer - This is the implementation that contains the catchment and sewer model only from the entire BSM-UWS implementation.

The model is described in the following papers
[Saagi, R., Flores-Alsina, X., Kroll, S., Gernaey, K. V., & Jeppsson, U. (2017). A model library for simulation and benchmarking of integrated urban wastewater systems. Environmental Modelling & Software, 93, 282–295.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.03.026)
